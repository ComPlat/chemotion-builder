# Your Chemotion instance is ready!

Congratulations, if you can see this text, your Chemotion instance is set up and you should be ready to login.

## Next steps

-   By default, we created an Administrator account with the username "ADM" and the password "PleaseChangeYourPassword". Login to the admin panel and change your password as soon as possible. There you will also find other settings and a way to create unprivileged users.
-   To change this message, edit the file `welcome-message.md` in the folder `shared/public/`.
